General:
	✔ Check leaks on error in load map @done(24-05-10 13:12)
	✔ Check that all possible errors handle in load map @done(24-05-10 13:12)
	✔ Add sprite animation @done(24-05-07 12:10)
	☐ Add doors

Improvements:
	✔ Fix stuck on walls when diagonal towards wall @done(24-04-30 09:27)
	✔ Set minimum distance from wall (player size), set to that distance if would otherwise go in wall @done(24-04-30 09:59)
	✔ Make movement calculate final new position then move, not x then y, weird if facing away from wall and moving diagonal towards it @done(24-05-04 17:39)
	☐ Optimization of drawing
		✔ Store image in correct form so abgr to rgba does not have to be called @done(24-05-05 08:56)
		☐ Store height of each hit into buffer, draw in horizontal lines (optional and a lot of work)
		✔ Dont draw every frame, only when someting moved @done(24-05-05 09:24)
	✔ Movement @done(24-05-10 14:49)
		✔ Make move input set e.g. xmove and ymove values, then call move player with those values @done(24-05-10 14:49)
		✔ Prevent diagonal speed up by making simultaneous y and x moves scale to a single move @done(24-05-10 14:49)
	☐ Error
		☐ "Empty file, or file contains only newline character, or error occurred when reading the file"
			☐ Could just be "Empty file" for empty file or nl file? (or "missing config" or "missing map")
			☐ Also printed when giving a directory as arg
		☐ "Invalid element: 11111111" (on missing config line), could this be more clear what is missing or something like "incomplete config"?
		☐ Map that is missing map prints "Map missing start position", maybe this could be more explicit that map is missing?
		☐ Duplicate of a color "Map contains an invalid character" but duplicate of a texture prints "Invalid element: NO ./textures/north_texture.png"
		☐ Make sure all errors follow the subject ""Error\n" followed by an explicit error message"

Bug fixes:
	✔ make re command does not work if MLX42 does not exist @done(24-05-08 11:04)
	✔ Fix player going through seam between two diagonal walls @done(24-04-30 10:00)
	✔ Fix player going through walls at really high speeds (e.g. using a raycast) @done(24-04-30 14:10)
	✔ Getting texture pixel sometimes goes out of max range of texture @done(24-05-06 12:42)
	✔ Minimap has a (single pixel?) line gap when player is touching a west or north facing wall @done(24-05-06 22:00)
	✔ RGB not checked for errors @done(24-05-08 14:29)
	✔ RGB still error because of atoi, e.g. 255,30a,0 is valid (fix with stricter atoi?) @done(24-05-10 09:35)
